# Local RAG Chatbot App

This is a simple open-source local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot application. It utilizes LangChain, Chroma for the vector database, and Ollama for the LLM (Large Language Model). The repository includes example PDF documents, and the functionality to embed and store documents in a new Chroma database collection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Creating a Conda Environment

To set up a new Conda environment, run the following commands:

```zsh
conda create --name my_project_env
conda activate my_project_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```zsh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Rename `.env.example` to  `.env`

3. Specify the environment parameters in the `.env` file.

## Executing the Program

### Creating a Chroma Database and Embedding Documents

You can create a Chroma database and embed documents using `util/chroma.py`. It requires one argument: the filepath to the documents you wish to embed and store.

Run the following command:

```zsh
python util/chroma.py ./assets/library
```

The results will be stored using your environment variables in a new Chroma database defined by `CHROMA_COLLECTION_NAME` and `CHROMA_PERSIST_PATH`.

### Running the Application


```zsh
docker-compose up
```

You should be able to view the app in your browser at the following URL:
